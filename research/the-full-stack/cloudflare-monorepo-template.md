```bash
git clone https://github.com/husniadil/cloudflare-workers-monorepo-project-template
cd cloudflare-workers-monorepo-project-template
yarn install
yarn dev
```

## Monorepo Benefits
- **Shared Code:** Common utilities across workers
- **Consistent Tooling:** Same build/test/deploy process
- **Efficient Dependencies:** Single lock file
- **Team Collaboration:** Better code organization
- **Scalability:** Easy to add new workers

## Use Cases
- Multiple microservices
- API gateways with multiple endpoints
- Serverless function collections
- Edge computing applications
- Complex serverless architectures

## Pros
- ✅ Proper monorepo structure
- ✅ Shared utilities support
- ✅ Automated deployment
- ✅ Testing framework included
- ✅ TypeScript throughout
- ✅ CI/CD ready

## Cons
- ❌ No frontend included
- ❌ No specific framework (Hono/TanStack)
- ❌ Generic structure (needs customization)
- ❌ Learning curve for monorepo concepts

## Integration Potential
- **Hono:** Can be added to individual workers
- **TanStack Start:** Could be adapted for full-stack
- **ShadCN:** Not applicable (backend only)
- **Frontend:** Separate frontend repo needed

## Deployment
```bash
# Deploy all workers
yarn deploy:all

# Deploy specific worker
yarn deploy:worker-1
```

## Learning Curve
- **Beginner:** High (monorepo concepts)
- **Intermediate:** Medium (familiar with Workers)
- **Advanced:** Low (scalable architecture)

## Community & Maintenance
- Moderate community interest (10 stars)
- Recent updates (July 2024)
- Good documentation
- MIT licensed

## Comparison to Others
- **vs Better T-Stack:** Backend only, multiple workers
- **vs BizQ Monorepo:** Similar structure but Workers-focused
- **vs Single Templates:** More complex but scalable

## Best For
- Teams managing multiple workers
- Microservices architectures
- Enterprise serverless deployments
- Projects requiring shared backend code
- Complex edge computing applications

## Last Updated
