---

## Phase 1: MVP - Core Task Automation (Weeks 1-4)

### Week 1-2: Foundation Infrastructure

#### Context Collection System
```typescript
// Minimal viable context system
class MVPContextSystem {
  // Start with email and document scanning only
  collectors = [
    new EmailCollector({ 
      providers: ['gmail', 'outlook'],
      extractPatterns: true 
    }),
    new DocumentScanner({ 
      sources: ['gdrive', 'dropbox'],
      autoIndex: true 
    })
  ];
  
  // Simple storage (no complex graph yet)
  storage = new SimpleContextStore({
    database: 'supabase',
    vectorSearch: 'basic_embeddings'
  });
}
```

#### Basic Validation
```typescript
// MVP validation - focus on safety
class MVPValidator {
  async validate(task: Task): Promise<boolean> {
    // Essential checks only
    const checks = [
      this.checkDataAccess(task),
      this.checkCostLimits(task),
      this.checkOutputSafety(task)
    ];
    
    return checks.every(check => check.passed);
  }
}
```

### Week 3-4: Five Core Tasks

**Task Priority** (based on user research):

1. **Product Description Generator** 
   - Highest ROI
   - 4 hours → 5 minutes
   - Clear quality metrics

2. **Customer Service Response**
   - Daily necessity
   - 2-4 hours saved daily
   - Immediate impact

3. **Social Media Content**
   - High frequency need
   - Visual results
   - Easy to evaluate

4. **Order Processing**
   - Operational efficiency
   - Measurable time savings
   - Automation showcase

5. **Daily Analytics Report**
   - Business intelligence
   - Decision support
   - Daily value

**MVP Success Criteria**:

## Phase 2: Agent Intelligence (Weeks 5-8)

### Week 5-6: Agent Framework

#### Agent Types
```typescript
interface MVPAgents {
  customerService: {
    capabilities: ['inquiries', 'complaints', 'escalation'],
    learning: 'from_corrections',
    autonomy: 'supervised'
  },
  contentCreation: {
    capabilities: ['product_desc', 'social_posts', 'emails'],
    learning: 'from_examples',
    autonomy: 'review_required'
  },
  orderProcessing: {
    capabilities: ['validation', 'fulfillment', 'tracking'],
    learning: 'from_patterns',
    autonomy: 'rule_based'
  }
}
```

#### Agent Management UI
```tsx
// Simple agent dashboard
function AgentDashboard() {
  return (
    <div>
      <AgentGrid agents={agents} />
      <LiveActivity />
      <QuickControls />
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Week 7-8: Learning & Improvement

**Progressive Trust System**:
1. **Observation Mode**: Agent suggests, human acts
2. **Approval Mode**: Agent acts with approval
3. **Supervised Mode**: Agent acts, human reviews
4. **Autonomous Mode**: Agent acts independently

**Learning Mechanisms**:
- Correction-based learning
- Pattern recognition
- Community knowledge sharing
- Continuous improvement loops
