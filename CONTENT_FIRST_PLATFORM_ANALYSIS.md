## Executive Summary

The content-first business model has become the dominant path for digital entrepreneurship. Creators currently juggle 10-15 different tools costing $500-2000/month. BizQ can consolidate this entire stack while adding task delegation capabilities that none of these platforms offer.

**Key Insight**: Every successful content business follows the same pattern:
1. Create valuable content
2. Build an email list
3. Grow a community
4. Monetize through subscriptions/products
5. Scale with automation

## Technical Architecture

```typescript
// Content Types
interface Article {
  title: string;
  slug: string;
  content: MDX;
  seo: SEOMetadata;
  author: Author;
  publishedAt: Date;
  subscribers_only: boolean;
}

interface Newsletter {
  subject: string;
  preheader: string;
  content: EmailHTML;
  segments: Segment[];
  scheduled_at: Date;
}
```

### Task Integration Layer
```typescript
// Content Tasks
class ContentTaskService {
  async createArticle(topic: string, keywords: string[]) {
    const task = await this.taskService.create({
      type: 'content.write_article',
      input: { topic, keywords },
      worker: 'ai'
    });
    
    return this.publishWhenComplete(task);
  }
  
  async optimizeContent(articleId: string) {
    const article = await this.getArticle(articleId);
    const improvements = await this.taskService.create({
      type: 'content.optimize_seo',
      input: { content: article },
      worker: 'ai'
    });
    
    return this.applyOptimizations(improvements);
  }
}
```

const weeklyNewsletterWorkflow = {
  trigger: 'schedule.weekly',
  steps: [
    { task: 'content.curate_articles', params: { count: 5 } },
    { task: 'content.write_introduction', params: { tone: 'friendly' } },
    { task: 'email.create_newsletter', params: { template: 'weekly' } },

## Why BizQ Wins

### The Unified Advantage
While competitors focus on one aspect (Ghost on publishing, ConvertKit on email, Circle on community), BizQ provides the complete stack with task automation that transforms how content businesses operate.

### The Delegation Difference
No other platform lets creators delegate tasks. This is the game-changer that lets solo creators operate like media companies.

### The Price Disruption
At $97/month, BizQ costs less than Circle alone while providing 10x the features. This pricing makes professional tools accessible to all creators.

### The Network Effect
As more creators join, the task marketplace improves, templates multiply, and the platform becomes more valuable for everyone.
