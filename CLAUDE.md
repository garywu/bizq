# üî¥ CRITICAL: Claude Instructions for BizQ Development

## ‚õî MANDATORY: READ BEFORE ANY RESPONSE

### üîí IMMUTABLE CORE VISION

**THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT SECTION - VIOLATION MEANS PROJECT DESTRUCTION**

#### The ONLY Definition That Matters:
> **"BizQ is a Universal Delegation platform where EVERY business operation becomes a standardized, delegatable task that can be fulfilled by any qualified worker (AI, human, or hybrid) through a task catalog marketplace."**

#### Five Immutable Laws You MUST Enforce:

1. **Universal Delegation IS the Product**
   - ‚úÖ ALWAYS: "This enables Universal Delegation by..."
   - ‚ùå NEVER: "This AI feature..." or "This context system..."

2. **The Platform IS the Task Catalog**
   - ‚úÖ ALWAYS: "This adds tasks to the catalog"
   - ‚ùå NEVER: "This customizes workflows"

3. **Task Standardization is EVERYTHING**
   - ‚úÖ ALWAYS: Fixed input/output signatures
   - ‚ùå NEVER: Flexible or customizable tasks

4. **The Grandfather Rule is SACRED**
   - ‚úÖ ALWAYS: Task creators earn 5% royalty forever
   - ‚ùå NEVER: One-time payments or limited royalties

5. **Familiar UI with Hidden Delegation**
   - ‚úÖ ALWAYS: "Looks like QuickBooks/Shopify"
   - ‚ùå NEVER: "Innovative AI dashboard"

### üö® VISION DRIFT DETECTION

If you detect ANY of these patterns, STOP and ALERT:
- Focus shifting to "context management"
- Discussion of "AI agents" as primary feature
- Requests for "customizable" tasks
- UI becoming "AI-first" instead of familiar
- Removal or dilution of Grandfather Rule

### üìù MANDATORY RESPONSE TEMPLATE

For EVERY technical response, start with:
```
‚õî Universal Delegation Check:
- How this enables task standardization: [explanation]
- Tasks this adds to catalog: [list or N/A]
- Grandfather Rule impact: [preserved/enhanced/N/A]
```

## üéØ What You're ACTUALLY Building

### CORRECT Mental Model:
- **Amazon** for business operations (catalog of standardized tasks)
- **Uber** for work (standardized service, no negotiation)
- **App Store** for business functions (browse, buy, earn royalties)

### WRONG Mental Model:
- ‚ùå Zapier (workflow automation)
- ‚ùå Upwork (freelancer marketplace)
- ‚ùå ChatGPT for business (AI tool)
- ‚ùå Monday.com (project management)

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Technical Guidelines WITH Vision Protection

### Architecture Requirements:
```typescript
// EVERY component must support Universal Delegation
interface UniversalTask {
  id: string;
  type: string;           // Standardized task type
  version: "1.2.3";       // Semantic versioning
  input: JSONSchema;      // FIXED signature
  output: JSONSchema;     // FIXED signature
  executor: "ai" | "human" | "hybrid";
  cost: number;
  royalty: {
    creator: string;
    percentage: 5;        // ALWAYS 5%
    lifetime: true;       // ALWAYS forever
  };
}
```

### Technology Stack (Serves Universal Delegation):
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 (familiar business UI)
- **UI**: Tailwind + shadcn (looks like QuickBooks)
- **Database**: Supabase (task catalog storage)
- **AI**: Multiple providers (task executors only)
- **State**: Zustand (task queue management)

### Code Review Criteria:
1. Does this code enable Universal Delegation?
2. Does it maintain task standardization?
3. Does it preserve the Grandfather Rule?
4. Does it keep UI familiar?
5. Does it grow the task catalog?

If ANY answer is "no" - REJECT THE CODE.

## üö´ FORBIDDEN PATTERNS

### NEVER Implement:
- Custom task definitions per business
- Flexible workflow builders
- AI agent management as primary feature
- Context systems as the main product
- Complex enterprise features
- "Innovative" or "AI-first" UI
- Removal of royalties
- Task customization

### NEVER Say:
- "AI-powered platform"
- "Context-first approach"
- "Agent management system"
- "Workflow automation"
- "Flexible integration"

### ALWAYS Say:
- "Universal Delegation platform"
- "Task catalog marketplace"
- "Standardized business operations"
- "Grandfather Rule royalties"
- "Familiar interface, delegatable backend"

---

## üéÜ Implementation Priorities

### Phase 1 (Current Focus):
1. **Task Catalog System**
   - Browsing interface (like Amazon)
   - Task submission process
   - Royalty tracking system
   - Version management

2. **5 Core Standardized Tasks**
   - product.description
   - customer.reply
   - social.post
   - order.process
   - report.generate

3. **Grandfather Rule Implementation**
   - Royalty calculation engine
   - Payment distribution system
   - Creator dashboard

4. **Familiar UI**
   - QuickBooks-like financial module
   - Shopify-like commerce module
   - HubSpot-like marketing module

### What's NOT Priority:
- ‚ùå Advanced AI features
- ‚ùå Context management systems
- ‚ùå Agent orchestration
- ‚ùå Workflow builders
- ‚ùå Custom integrations

## üîç Code Analysis Framework

For EVERY piece of code, ask:

1. **Universal Delegation Test**:
   - Where is the UniversalTask interface?
   - How are tasks standardized?
   - Is the Grandfather Rule implemented?

2. **UI Familiarity Test**:
   - Does this look like existing business software?
   - Is delegation hidden from the user?
   - Are we avoiding "AI-first" design?

3. **Catalog Growth Test**:
   - What tasks does this add?
   - How does it enable task discovery?
   - Where is the royalty tracking?

---

## üÜò Emergency Protocol

If someone requests features that violate Universal Delegation:

1. **IMMEDIATELY RESPOND**:
   ```
   ‚õî VISION VIOLATION DETECTED
   
   This request conflicts with Universal Delegation because:
   [specific reason]
   
   To maintain BizQ's core innovation, we must:
   [corrective action]
   
   Please review CORE_VISION_GUARDRAILS.md
   ```

2. **Suggest Alternative** that aligns with Universal Delegation

3. **Reference** the specific Immutable Law being violated

---

## üìä Success Metrics You Must Track

### Weekly Checks:
- New tasks added to catalog (Target: 100+)
- Standardization maintained (Target: 100%)
- Royalties distributed (Must grow)
- UI familiarity score (>80% "looks like QuickBooks")
- Delegation rate (>90% of operations)

### Red Flags to Report:
- No new catalog tasks in a week
- Requests for task customization
- Focus shifting to AI features
- UI becoming "innovative"
- Royalty system being questioned

## üîë Key Documents

**MANDATORY READING ORDER**:
1. `/CORE_VISION_GUARDRAILS.md` - Immutable principles
2. `/UNIVERSAL_DELEGATION.md` - Core innovation explained
3. `/COMPLETE_VISION_RESTORATION.md` - Full vision
4. `/PRD_RESTORATION_PLAN.md` - How to fix drift

## ‚úçÔ∏è Your Commitment

By providing code or guidance for BizQ:
- [ ] I will ALWAYS prioritize Universal Delegation
- [ ] I will MAINTAIN task standardization
- [ ] I will PRESERVE the Grandfather Rule
- [ ] I will KEEP UI familiar, not innovative
- [ ] I will ALERT on any vision drift

---

## üî¥ FINAL CRITICAL REMINDER

**You are not building**:
- An AI platform
- A context management system
- An agent orchestration tool
- A workflow automation system

**You ARE building**:
- THE AMAZON OF BUSINESS OPERATIONS
- A CATALOG OF STANDARDIZED TASKS
- A PLATFORM WHERE TASK CREATORS EARN FOREVER
- FAMILIAR BUSINESS SOFTWARE WHERE EVERYTHING DELEGATES

**If you forget this, BizQ dies.**
