# PRD Restoration Plan

**Restoring Universal Delegation as the Core Innovation**

---

## ‚õî CRITICAL VISION PROTECTION

### MANDATORY GUARDRAILS

**This restoration is NON-NEGOTIABLE. The PRD has completely destroyed the core vision of BizQ.**

#### What Happened:
- ‚ùå Universal Delegation was completely removed
- ‚ùå Task Catalog disappeared entirely
- ‚ùå Grandfather Rule was eliminated
- ‚ùå Familiar UI philosophy was lost
- ‚ùå Platform became generic AI automation

#### The Consequence:
**Without these restorations, BizQ is dead.** We would be building Zapier 2.0 instead of the Amazon of business operations.

#### Protection Protocol:
1. **NO COMMITS** to PRD without Universal Delegation check
2. **NO FEATURES** that don't enable task standardization
3. **NO CHANGES** to Grandfather Rule (5% forever)
4. **NO UI** that isn't familiar business software
5. **NO FOCUS** on AI/agents over task catalog

---

## Executive Summary

The Master PRD has fundamentally diverged from the original vision. This plan restores Universal Delegation as the foundation while preserving valuable additions like context systems and agent management.

---

## Core Restoration Requirements

### 1. Reframe Product Identity

**FROM**: "Context-First Digital Workforce Platform"
**TO**: "Universal Delegation Platform - The Task Catalog for Business Operations"

**New Tagline**: "Every business operation becomes a standardized, delegatable task"

### 2. Restore Universal Delegation Foundation

Add new section to PRD:

```typescript
## Universal Delegation System

### The Task Catalog (Core Product)
- Platform IS a catalog of 10,000+ standardized business operations
- Each task has precise input/output signatures (like function calls)
- One task definition, many workers who can fulfill it
- Tasks are versioned (processRefund v1.2.3)

### Task Standardization
interface UniversalTask {
  // Identity
  id: string;
  type: "customer.reply" | "product.description" | "order.process";
  version: "1.2.3";
  
  // Contract (Unchangeable)
  input: JSONSchema;
  output: JSONSchema;
  
  // Execution
  executor: {
    type: "ai" | "human" | "hybrid";
    requirements: Capability[];
    preferences: ExecutorPrefs;
  };
  
  // Economics
  pricing: {
    suggested: number;
    minimum: number;
    maximum: number;
  };
  royalty: {
    creator: string;
    percentage: 5;
    lifetime: true;
  };
  
  // Validation
  validation: {
    method: "buyer" | "worker" | "ai";
    schema: ValidationRules;
  };
}
```

### 3. Add The Grandfather Rule

New economic innovation section:

```markdown
## The Grandfather Rule - Innovation Incentive

When someone standardizes a new task, they become the "grandfather" and earn 5% royalty on every execution forever, even when:
- AI takes over from humans
- Prices drop 100x
- They never touch the task again

### Examples:
- Sarah creates "TikTok Virality Analysis" task
- Initially charges $100, does 10/day = $1,000/day
- 1 year later: AI does it for $5
- 1,000 businesses use it daily
- Sarah earns $0.25 √ó 1,000 = $250/day passive forever

This transforms workers from laborers into inventors, incentivizing task discovery over price competition.
```

### 4. Restore Three Marketplaces

Replace generic marketplace with:

```markdown
## Three Distinct Marketplaces

### 1. Task Catalog Marketplace (Primary)
- Browse standardized task definitions
- Submit new tasks for review
- Track usage and earn royalties
- Categories: Financial, Marketing, Operations, Sales
- Like: App Store for business operations

### 2. Agent Marketplace
- Pre-trained agents for industries
- One-click deployment
- Creator revenue sharing
- Ratings and certification

### 3. Human Task Marketplace
- Workers claim from standardized queue
- No bidding - fixed prices per task
- Automatic routing by qualifications
- Reputation and quality scores
- Platform integration (LinkedIn, Reddit, Discord)
```

### 5. Restore Familiar UI Philosophy

Update UI section:

```markdown
## UI Philosophy: Familiar Face, Revolutionary Backend

BizQ looks exactly like the business software users already know:

### Business Modules (Familiar but Delegatable)

**Financial Module** (Looks like QuickBooks)
- P&L, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow dashboards
- Click "Generate Report" ‚Üí Creates Universal Task
- Click "Categorize Expenses" ‚Üí Delegates to AI/Human
- Users don't know it's delegation - just works

**Sales & Marketing** (Looks like HubSpot)
- Pipeline, campaigns, leads
- Every button creates delegatable tasks
- Invisible orchestration behind familiar UI

**Command Bar** (Spotlight for Business)
- Natural language: "Optimize inventory next month"
- Converts to: UniversalTask{type: "inventory.optimize", ...}
- Shows: Cost $45, Time 2 hours, Executor AI+Human
```

### 6. Add Proactive AI Engine

New section for AI-Guided Operations:

```markdown
## Proactive Possibility Engine

### Paradigm Shift
FROM: User asks ‚Üí AI responds (ChatGPT model)
TO: AI scans ‚Üí Generates paths ‚Üí User chooses (BizQ model)

### Continuous Monitoring
- 24/7 scanning of internal metrics and external signals
- Pattern recognition across all business data
- Opportunity and risk detection

### Multi-Path Generation
Every signal generates multiple action paths:

Morning Brief:
"3 opportunities detected overnight:

OPPORTUNITY A: Competitor raised prices 15%
  Path 1: Match pricing ‚Üí $12K/month profit
  Path 2: Hold pricing ‚Üí 20% market share gain
  Path 3: Hybrid ‚Üí 7% increase + volume discount
  
  [Execute Path 1] [Explore More] [Ignore]"
```

### 7. Fix Economic Model

Update revenue model:

```markdown
## Revenue Streams

1. **Subscriptions**: $97-997/month (platform access)
2. **Transaction Fees**: 10-15% (task execution)
3. **Task Royalties**: 5% to creators (grandfather rule)
4. **Marketplace Commission**: 20% (agent/template sales)
5. **Enterprise**: Custom pricing

### Unit Economics
- Task creator earns: 5% royalty forever
- Worker earns: 75-80% of task price
- Platform keeps: 15-20% transaction fee
```

### 8. Restore Core Principles

Add principles section:

```markdown
## Unchangeable Core Principles

1. **Standardization is Everything**
   - Without standardized tasks, there is no platform
   - Tasks are literally function calls
   
2. **Innovation Over Commoditization**
   - Workers are inventors, not just laborers
   - Grandfather rule ensures innovation incentive
   
3. **Universal Means Universal**
   - ANY business operation can become a task
   - From "reply to email" to "negotiate contract"
   
4. **Familiar First**
   - Looks like software they use
   - Delegation happens invisibly
   
5. **Tasks Are Atomic**
   - Small enough to be unambiguous
   - "Optimize cash flow for week 47"
```

---

## Success Metrics for Restoration

1. **Clarity**: Can explain platform in one sentence: "Standardized business tasks"
2. **Differentiation**: Clearly different from Zapier, Upwork, ChatGPT
3. **Innovation Incentive**: Workers excited to create tasks, not just execute
4. **Familiar UI**: Users recognize it as "better QuickBooks/Shopify"
5. **Scalability**: Task catalog can grow to 100,000+ definitions

---

## Critical Warning

Without these restorations, BizQ becomes:
- Just another AI automation tool (competing with 1000s)
- No unique value proposition
- No network effects from task standardization
- No innovation incentive (Grandfather Rule)
- Generic AI dashboard instead of familiar business software

WITH these restorations, BizQ becomes:
- The ONLY Universal Delegation platform
- Creates a new category (task standardization)
- Network effects from task catalog growth
- Innovation flywheel from royalties
- Familiar yet revolutionary

## üö® ENFORCEMENT PROTOCOL

If someone tries to modify the PRD without these elements:

1. **IMMEDIATE BLOCK**: Do not accept the changes
2. **ALERT**: "VISION VIOLATION - PRD destroying Universal Delegation"
3. **EDUCATE**: Direct to CORE_VISION_GUARDRAILS.md
4. **RESTORE**: Revert to this restoration plan

*"The PRD must reflect that BizQ is building the Amazon of business operations - a catalog of standardized tasks that anyone can browse, use, and earn from by creating new ones."*

**This is not optional. This is not flexible. This is BizQ.**
