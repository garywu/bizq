## The Problem We Solve

### Current State: Tool Chaos
Businesses currently juggle:
- **E-commerce**: Shopify + Klaviyo + Gorgias + ShipStation + QuickBooks (15-20 tools)
- **Content**: Ghost + ConvertKit + Circle + Stripe + Analytics (10-15 tools)  
- **Services**: CRM + Projects + Invoicing + Support + Marketing (20+ tools)

**Result**: 
- $3000-7000/month in subscriptions
- 30+ different logins
- Zero integration
- Manual work everywhere
- 4-6 hours/day on operations

### Root Cause: Fragmentation
Every SaaS solves one problem, creating:
- Integration nightmares
- Data silos
- Process gaps
- Scaling barriers
- Knowledge requirements
