# Competitor Pain Points Analysis

**Understanding the Fundamental Problems Content Creators Face with Current Platforms**

---

## Executive Summary

After extensive analysis of user complaints across major content platforms, three critical themes emerge:
1. **Platform Lock-in**: Users can't easily move their content, subscribers, or data
2. **Hidden Costs**: Platforms start cheap but become expensive as you grow
3. **Feature Fragmentation**: No single platform does everything, forcing creators to use 5-10 tools

**Key Insight**: Creators are trapped between platforms that are either too simple (Substack) or too expensive (Circle), with no middle ground that offers both power and affordability.
