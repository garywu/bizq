    this.serviceId = config.serviceId;
    this.serviceName = config.serviceName;
    this.category = config.category;
    this.pricing = config.pricing;
    this.capabilities = config.capabilities;
  }

  // Core Methods Every Provider Must Implement
  async authenticate(businessId, credentials) {
    // Verify provider has permission for this business
    return await BizQ.verify(this.serviceId, businessId, credentials);
  }

  async getRequiredData(businessId) {
    // Define minimum data needed to perform service
    return {
      dataPoints: ['revenue', 'expenses', 'cashFlow'],
      updateFrequency: 'daily',
      historicalRange: '90_days',
      permissions: ['read_financial', 'write_recommendations']
    };
  }

  async execute(businessId, data) {
    // Perform the specialized service
    const result = await this.processService(data);
    return {
      status: 'success',
      actions: result.actions,
      metrics: result.metrics,
      recommendations: result.recommendations
    };
  }

  async report(businessId, period) {
    // Generate performance reports
    return {
      kpis: this.calculateKPIs(businessId, period),
      improvements: this.getImprovements(),
      savings: this.calculateSavings(),
      nextActions: this.getRecommendations()
    };
  }
}

// Example: Cash Flow Optimizer Service
class CashFlowOptimizer extends MicroServiceProvider {
  constructor() {
    super({
      serviceId: 'cashflow_optimizer_001',
      serviceName: 'AI Cash Flow Optimizer',
      category: 'financial',
      pricing: { monthly: 5, usage: 0 },

        'payables_management',
        'cash_forecast_13_weeks'
      ]
    });
  }

  async processService(data) {
    // Specialized cash flow optimization logic
    const optimizations = this.analyzeFlows(data);
    const actions = this.generateActions(optimizations);
    
    return {
      actions: [
        'Delay payment to Supplier X by 7 days',
        'Offer 2% discount for immediate payment to Customer Y',
        'Transfer $5K from Business A to Business B'
      ],
      metrics: {
        cashRunwayImproved: '3_weeks',
        workingCapitalFreed: 15000,
        interestSaved: 125
      },
      recommendations: [
        'Negotiate 30-day terms with top 3 suppliers',
        'Implement automated invoice follow-ups'
      ]
    };
  }
}
```
