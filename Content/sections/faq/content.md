# Frequently Asked Questions

## Questions

### How does BizQ differ from automation tools like Zapier?
BizQ is not just automation - it's universal delegation. We standardize entire business operations into delegatable tasks, not just API connections. AI handles routine work, human experts manage complexity, all through familiar interfaces.

### Can I create my own tasks for the catalog?
Absolutely! When you standardize a new business operation, you earn 5% royalties on every execution forever. Your innovation becomes passive income while helping other businesses.

### What happens when AI can't complete a task?
Tasks automatically route to qualified human specialists. You set confidence thresholds, and our system ensures the right worker (AI or human) handles each task based on complexity and your preferences.

### How do royalties work for task creators?
Standardize a task definition and earn 5% on every execution. Unlike traditional marketplaces, royalties continue forever even when AI takes over. One good task can generate thousands in passive income.

### Can I manage multiple businesses with BizQ?
Yes! BizQ transforms solo entrepreneurs into portfolio operators. Manage 1-1000 businesses through standardized operations. Our portfolio dashboard shows all businesses at once with pattern recognition across your entire operation.
