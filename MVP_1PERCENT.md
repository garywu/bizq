# The 1% MVP: Proving BizQ Works

**The absolute minimum to validate the entire concept**

---

## The Core Hypothesis to Prove

**"Businesses will pay $297/month to delegate their daily operations as standardized tasks to AI/human workers through a simple UI"**

To prove this, we need to demonstrate:
1. Tasks can be standardized and delegated
2. AI can handle 80% reliably
3. Users will trust the system
4. The economics work

CREATE TABLE tasks (type, input, output, status, worker)
CREATE TABLE transactions (task_id, cost, credits)
```

### Day 3-4: Task Execution Engine
```typescript
@Injectable()
export class TaskService {
  async executeTask(type: string, input: any) {
    switch(type) {
      case 'email.reply_to_customer':
        return this.aiWorker.generateEmail(input);
      case 'customer.urgent_complaint':
        return this.humanWorker.assign(input);
      // ... 3 more task types
    }
  }
}
```

### Day 5-6: Simple UI
```tsx
// One page with 4 components
<TaskCreator />      // Dropdown + form
<ActiveTasks />      // List with status
<CompletedTasks />   // Results + ratings
<CreditBalance />    // $X remaining
```

### Day 7: Integration
- Connect Stripe for payments
- Connect OpenAI for AI tasks
- Create simple admin panel for human tasks

---

## Week 2: Get 10 Users & Iterate

### Day 8-9: Recruit Test Users

- Reach out to Shopify store owners
- Offer free credits + consultation

### Day 10-11: Onboarding
- 15-minute Zoom setup for each
- Connect their Shopify store
- Show them how to delegate first task
- Give them $100 in free credits

### Day 12-13: Daily Operations
- Monitor task completion
- Handle human tasks manually
- Gather feedback via daily check-ins
- Fix critical bugs immediately

### Day 14: Analyze Results
- Task completion rates
- User satisfaction scores
- Cost per task
- Willingness to pay
- Feature requests

---

## The Data We Need to Collect

### Usage Metrics
- Tasks created per day
- Task completion time
- AI vs human distribution
- Task success rate
- User return rate

### Economic Metrics
- Cost per task type
- Average daily spend
- Platform margin
- Customer acquisition cost
- Lifetime value projection

### Qualitative Feedback
- What tasks do they want to delegate?
- What's stopping them from using it more?
- How much would they pay?
- What features are missing?
- Would they recommend it?

---

## Success = These Numbers

### Proof of Concept Success
```
Week 2 Targets:
- 10 active users
- 100 tasks/day total
- 80% AI completion
- $3 average cost per user per day
- 3+ users want to continue
- 4.0+ satisfaction rating
```

### Ready to Scale Indicators
```
If we achieve:
- 50% daily active usage
- $297 willingness to pay
- 80% task satisfaction
- Positive unit economics
- Clear feature roadmap from feedback

Then we've proven:
→ The delegation model works
→ AI can handle most tasks
→ Businesses will pay
→ We can scale it
```

## What We're NOT Building (Yet)

- ❌ Task marketplace
- ❌ Worker bidding system
- ❌ 190+ task types
- ❌ Complex integrations
- ❌ Mobile app
- ❌ Analytics dashboard
- ❌ Team collaboration
- ❌ API access
- ❌ White label option

### Why This Works
- Focuses on core value prop
- Proves delegation model
- Tests willingness to pay
- Validates AI capability
- Identifies real needs

## The Pitch After MVP

**"In 2 weeks, we built a platform where businesses delegated 1,000 tasks with 80% AI completion and 4.5-star satisfaction. Users saved 3 hours/day and want to pay $297/month. We need $2M to scale to 1,000 businesses."**

### Proof Points
- Working product
- Real users
- Validated economics
- Clear roadmap
- Massive market

---

## Why This 1% Is Enough

### It Proves Everything
1. **Technical**: Can we route tasks to workers?
2. **Product**: Will users trust delegation?
3. **Economic**: Do unit economics work?
4. **Market**: Will businesses pay?

### It's Fast to Build
- 2 weeks with one developer
- Uses proven technology
- No complex features
- Focus on core value

### It's Cheap to Test
- <$10k total investment
- 10 users enough for validation
- Clear success metrics
- Quick iteration cycles

---

## The Decision Point

After 2 weeks, we'll know:
- **GO**: Users love it, economics work → Raise funding, scale fast
- **PIVOT**: Users want different tasks → Adjust and retest
- **STOP**: Users don't trust delegation → Try different approach

*"Test the riskiest assumption with the smallest possible experiment."*

**The riskiest assumption**: Businesses will delegate operations to AI/human workers through standardized tasks.

**The smallest experiment**: 5 task types, 10 users, 2 weeks.

**Let's build it.**
